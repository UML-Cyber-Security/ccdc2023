# NOTICE

This is a file with a grab bag of fixes that could possibly be run remotely. Some can be applied as a default without breaking the system. But the application of some could break how the system is operating. 

The SC.sh contains some of the potentially more useful commands that have yet to be separated out.

The Mounting one can safely be ignored.

The KernelModules.sh could be applicable. We just need to make sure the Protocols and FileSystems are not in use.

GRUB-Bootloader my be interesting but not too applicable.

MOTD, likely is not important unless asked?
