Here are some useful PowerShell scripts that I use to evaluate customer’s SQL environments. They make no changes to anything but are useful for reporting and verification purposes and write the output to a file in a nice and clean tabular format.

Enjoy!

The scripts are as follows:

    GetMAXDOP.ps1 – Reports on the current MAXDOP setting
    GetSQLConfigInfo.ps1 – Reports on general SQL settings
    GetSQLServerCores.ps1 – Reports on the number of cores presented to SQL and the number of TempDB data files allocated
