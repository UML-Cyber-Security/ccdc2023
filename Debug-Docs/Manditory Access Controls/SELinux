# What is it
 SELinux is a Mandatory Access Control. We can use it to limit what programs running on the system can do. In this case SELinux is a deny be defualt where we whitelist what programs can or cannot do.


 # Commands
 
 WE can look at the current status 
 ```
 sestatus
```
# Note
We can install and run SELinux on Ubuntu based systems. 
We can use it on containers as well
