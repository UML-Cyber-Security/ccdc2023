# What is it
 SELinux is a Mandatory Access Control. We can use it to limit what programs running on the system can do. In this case SELinux is a deny be default where we whitelist what programs can or cannot do.

 # Commands
 
 We can look at the current status 
 ```
 sestatus
```

We can list all of the modules loaded on the system 
```
semodule -l
```

We can see what state SELinux is in. It can be in Permissive (0) which allows things not defined in a ruleset or module or Enforce (1)
```
getenforce
```

We can set/change the state with the following 
```
setenforce 1
or 
setenforce 0
```


Using the permissive version we can interact with files and our services can utilize systemcalls and interact with other files without restrictions.

We will need to look at the logs generated by the processes to determine how we should configure the profiles for a process.

```  
sudo sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log
```

We can run the suggested commands to further create a profile for a service.

# SELinux Terms 

Each file and directory gets a user, role and type context we can look at this using the following 

```
ls -Z 
```

Each file or directory also has a selinux boolean we can llo at this using the following. The grep will isolate a specific profiles booleans.

```
 
 
 sudo getsebool -a | grep "httpd_can"
 ```

 We can change the boolean using the setsebool command  


# Note
We can install and run SELinux on Ubuntu based systems. 
We can use it on containers as well
